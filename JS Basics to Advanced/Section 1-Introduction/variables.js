 Rules for naming JS variables
 - Name can contain letters, digits, _ and $
 var mySubject, math$
 - Names cannot start with a digit
 var 1math; this will result to an error
 - Name can start with an _ or $
 var _subjectMarks; var $MiddleName;
 - Names are Case sensitive
var x; and var X; are two different variable names
 - Names cannot be reserved key words
var var/const; will result to an error as they are keywords
